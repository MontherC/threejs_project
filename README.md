# threejs_project

This is a project made with threejs and React. It allows a user to interact with a responsive 3d model of a shirt, 
change it's color, and it's logo.

At the moment the AI functionality is not active due to openai charging for each image generated.

The AI can be corrected by inputting your own paid(or free with tokens) api key for openAi.

The deployed project can be viewed [here](https://montherc.github.io/3js_Web/).
